# Pro Tool
Pro Tool is the rust rewrite of (Personal Running Order Tool)[https://github.com/lobneroO/PersonalRunningOrderTool].
This is in the early stages, so non functional yet.
Ultimately, you will be able to create time tables of an event and schedules to your liking.
There is no real reason for a rust rewrite, except giving myself a reason to program in rust.
